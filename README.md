This repo is to enable ss-redir on Entware / OpenWRT / Ubuntu.

The main idea is to use ss-redir to reroute traffics to server in China.
The specified ips/domains are in nat.sh and list.

The domain myip.com is also on the list that after installation if visit myip.com it will show you are in China.

The maintainance and test doesn't cover much, but I always use this to enable extra benefits from Netease Cloud Music.
Once it is successfully deployed, you can check that none of the musics is grey out.
